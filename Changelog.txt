Version 2.0 Rel.5
Build 141 - 8 aug. 2008:
1: Fix: Access violation ved "gen i <var>", hvis <var> allerede eksisterer.
2: Feature (mantis 274): Info if output if a select is present or a command specific IF is applied.
3: Fix: Sorting tables now also works for /FV option.
4: Added: Test for .chk-file relating to .rec file for labels and proper saving/restoring.
5: Fix: If tables with /FV or /CC option contained variables which combined had no data, an error occured. Now an info is displayed (that combination contains no data) and table not included in final output.
6: Fix: Using SPACE/ENTER in the variable window (F3) cause sometimes strange behaviour, not correctly showing chosen vars and vars on command promt.

Build 142 - 11 aug. 2008:
1: Added: Option /NT for boxplot - no display of the table containing percentiles.
2: Change: Moved "MIN" to top of list in boxplot table display.
3: Fix (Mantis 282): Tables respecting /VN /VNL for /CC /OA etc.
4: Added: New TTableFormats - a record holding information about the different formats in tables unit.
5: Change: Streamlined table output for compact tables (/OA and /CC ). See "InternalOutputStatHeader" in UOutput.pas
6: Added: TSKTableAnalysis implemented as prototype for Svend Kreiner

Build 143 - 13. aug. 2008:
1: Change: In tables - /CC removed. /CT, /RR and /AR added. /AR works as /RR + Attack Rate info. /OA now works as /CT /AR. 
2: Added (Mantis 283): "SET TABLE CT OR/RR HEADER" set options implemented. Controls header in /O and /RR compact tables.
3: Added: Reading data from clipboard marks data as modified - hence, reading again is only allowed if current data is explicitly closed.
4: Fix: Removed unwanted lines fra graph with PNG files.
5: Fix: Compact table types now gives correct html divideing line between header and table content.
6: Suspended: /NM option put as "always on" for CIPlot, due to incorrect missing calculations.
7: Fix: Header for N columen corrected - now it display the chosen outcome value(label).

Build 144 - 20. aug. 2008:
1: Fix: In tables - No longer fails when using /O and /RR together without /CT
2: Change: Tables dialog commandline now matches changes in tables command options.
3: Added: Set option - LIFETABLE INTERVAL = 0,7,15,30,60,90,180,360,540,720 added. Used for interval in LifeTable.
4: New: LifeTable command - displays Survival Table and posibly (/G) Kaplan-Meier curve.
5: Added: Footer property on TStatTable.
6: Added: Set option - LIFETABLE HEADER = "Interval,Beg. Total,Deaths,Lost,Survival,Std. Error" added. Used for headers in LifeTable.
7: Added: NormalizeVectorNames to TEpiDataFrame. Changes all $... varnames to equivalent without $.

Build 145 - 1. Sept. 2008:
1: Added: /Close with LifeTable marks data as modified.
2: Fix: Correctly reports if dataframe contains no data in LifeTable.
3: Fix: Problems with manually defined intervals.
4: Fix: Sorting in browse windows (with a selected set of variables) not longer reloads the dataframe with full set of variables.

Build 146 - 2. Sept. 2008:
1: Change: Rewritten CIPlot. Now supports /NM option but not /BY (yet).
2: Added: Properties on TTwoWaytable. Can now access grand row header, grand colomn header, individual row headers (label/value) and individual column headers (label/value).

Build 147 - 3. Sept. 2008:
1: Fix: "RUN" botton in graph dialog didn't work - fixed.
2: Axis titles applied for scatter, line, dotplot, cdfplot, epicurve, ciplot
3: Fix: Situation where expanding dataframe with a single NA_... as the last entry in expanding vector, would cause the next entry to contain NA_... +1 (usually resulting in an error).
4: Fix: Using a single var with line/scatter caused an error.
5: Change: In graph dialog - first variable is no longer displayed as optional and BY variable box is also no longer displayed (by not implemented).
6: Fix: Some errors not displayed correctly due to malformatted dm.error(...) function call.
7: Change: Epicurve - Outcome is stripped of missing.
8: Change: Deleted previous introduced initial size of a TEpiStringVector. This induced a problem with reading data in some instances.
9: Added: New option /NOTOT for CIPlot = do not display total (including 95% CI lines).
10: Updated language file.

Build 148 - 4. Sept. 2008:
1: New (Mantis 286): Add multiple variable support for Boxplot.
2: Added: New /NM option for new Boxplot implementation.
3: Change: A dot (".") has been added label values when using recode in the form "Recode A to B x=y", such that label for value y in B is ".x"
4: Added: Label value command from "recode" added to history.
5: Fix: CIplot - options /NOTOT and /NOCI are now independt of eachother.
6: Fix: CIplot - removed errornous extra "|" at end of bottom axis title.
7: Added: Recode - /Clear option added, and default /Clear removed from labelvalue line.
8: Change: Added /NG to LifeTable, ciplot, boxplot, epicurve
9: Remode: /G from lifetable - in addition with (8) adjusted dialog accordingly.
10: New: Stattables implemented.
11:     - Options /Close, /Page /Strata implemented.
12: Change: Unified certain options for commands.
13: Change: Moved "SplitString" from smUtils to UGeneralUtils.
