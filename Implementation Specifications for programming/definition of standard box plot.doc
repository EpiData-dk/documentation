Default (internal) algorithm does the following steps:

1. Finds the sample Median, Quartile1, Quartile3 and IQR value.

2. Finds InnerFence1 and InnerFence3 by using the following equation:
InnerFence1 = Quartile1 - WhiskerLength*IQR
InnerFence3 = Quartile3 + WhiskerLength*IQR

3. Finds AdjacentPoint1 and AdjacentPoint3
     AdjacentPoint1 is the data point that is
       closest to InnerFence1, without lying bellow InnerFence1. 
     AdjacentPoint3 is the data point that is
       closest to InnerFence3, without lying above InnerFence3. 

4. Finds OuterFence1 and OuterFence3 by using the following equation:
OuterFence1 = Quartile1 - 2*WhiskerLength*IQR
OuterFence3 = Quartile3 + 2*WhiskerLength*IQR


5. Constructs a box with ends at Quartile1 and Quartile3 with an interior line draw at the Median.

6. Indicates adjacent points and connects them to the box with lines. Locates any data points falling between the inner and outer fences and denotes them by a symbol. These points are considered to be mild outliers. Indicates data points that fall beyond the outer fences by another symbol. These points are considered to be extreme outliers.
