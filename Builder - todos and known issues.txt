Todo:
* Implement other field types.
* Import function -> importing DF from known formats and placing components.
 - importing/creating from QES file.
* Switch that enables copying properties from last edited field or double click function.
* Auto layout button -> automatically creates a linear building of fields.
* Shortcuts.
 - F2 = Int, F3 = Float, F4 = .... etc.
 - Using "shift" copies previous inserted field with new field name and no variable label.
* Scrollbar on design panel.
* Edits in designers autoselects text - an unwanted feature.

Know Issues:
* With only one field on form, the docking behaves stranges.



Nice to have:
* OnChanged hook on TEpiDataFile.



Completed:
* Edit forms on using pop-up menu is placed incorrectly.
* OnChanged hook on TEpiField
