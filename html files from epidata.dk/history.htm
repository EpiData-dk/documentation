Why develop EpiData</h3>
<p>
<b>1999</B><br>
The initiative to make EpiData was taken by Jens M.Lauritsen. MD. Ph.d. from Denmark. Initially as part of the "Initiative for Accident Prevention" at Funen County - but why develop a new data entry programme ?
<br><br>
EpiInfo version 6 has all that we need in terms of control of data entry and simplicity.  But with development of windows like programs most users find it hard to cope with the "dos" mode of working in EpiInfo developed during 1990-1995.
<br><br>
On the EpiInfo discussion list there were some discussions on strategies around 1997-1998, when the EpiInfo team at CDC in USA decided to make an updated EpiInfo version 2000.
The updated EpiInfo applies a different strategy in using a completely new way of working and the Access database format instead of simple text files (ascii).
<br><br>
Commercially available programs are not focused on documentation, simplicity of use and validation of double entered data. EpiData is a program with focus on dataentry. For analysis one can use EpiInfo 2000, Stata, SAS or whatever preference.
<br><br>
Since Mark Myatt had similar viewpoints on development strategies he was contacted by Jens M.Lauritsen towards the end of 1999 and agreed to join the EpiData development team which at that point also included a skilled pascal programmer Michael Bruus, who is doing the actual programming.
<br><br>
The ambition of EpiData is to create a simple to use independent application, which will not interfere with or require any special database system drivers (dll based routines) shared with or interfering with other applications.

<b>Versions of EpiData released:</b>
<br>V1.2 (Nov. 22th). V1.01 (Oct. 11th, new build Oct.19th). V1.0 (Sept. 12th)
<br><br>

The  first release of EpiData. More than 200 persons around the world helped with finding bugs
defining what was needed and suggesting extensions.

<b>Versions of EpiData released:</b>
<br>v2.1 (Dec 10th) v2.0 (Aug 10th) V1.5 (Feb 22nd)  v1.3 (Jan 15th).
<p>
An international group of "Friends of EpiData" was formed with the purpose of securing
further funding for the development of EpiData. See <a href="credit.htm">the credit page</a>

<p> The effort has been an important step in getting support for further development.

<h3 style="background-image: url('grafik/r.png'); background-repeat: repeat-x;">
EpiData Association</h3>

Since the work had to be separated from the originating part in Funen County
due to conflicting in not to take up too much time and to make external support easier to
handle the independent association was started by Jens M.Lauritsen, Michael Bruus and Mark Myatt.

Salah Mahmud born in Libya joined the core development group. He is a resident of Montreaul Canada.
Salah Mahmud will take part as a skilled and experienced delphi programmer
and public health trained person in specifying further development.

<p><b>March</b>
<br>A 3 day planning seminar was held in Christiansminde, Denmark by
Michael Bruus, Salah Mahmud and Jens M.Lauritsen.
<p>The purpose was to write a first version of a plan for further development of analysis,
reporting and possibly menuing additions. Including programming trials.

<p><B>Mid May</B><br>
Specification seminar held in Canada arranged by Jamie Hockin Health Canada and
Jens M.Lauritsen. Special focus on what types of analysis are needed in public health
which cannot be done by other software.
Definition of "case studies" for specification of further development.
